## Question 1 
# a(i)

install.packages("leaps")
library(leaps)

# Assuming 'biomass' is your data frame
model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x3 + x2 + x4, data = biomass)
model_p <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = biomass)

Cp <- leaps(
  x = biomass[, 2:5],
  y = biomass$y,
  names = names(biomass)[2:5],
  method = "Cp"
)

r2 <- leaps(
  x = biomass[, 2:5],
  y = biomass$y,
  method = "r2"
)

adjr2 <- leaps(
  x = biomass[, 2:5],
  y = biomass$y,
  method = "adjr2"
)

result <- cbind(
  Cp$which,
  R2 = r2$r2,
  AdjR2 = adjr2$adjr2,
  MallowCp = Cp$Cp,
  p = Cp$size
)


Answer is model with y = b0 + b1x1 + b4x4
